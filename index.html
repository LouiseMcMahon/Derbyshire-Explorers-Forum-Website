	<p>The Derbyshire* Explorers Forum will be a day of talks where you can hear about all the underground exploits of Derbyshire both current and historical. Hosted by the <a href="https://tsgcaving.co.uk/" target="_blank">Technical Speleological Group</a> (TSG) as part of their 50th anniversary celebrations, on the 30th of September in <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/fw6e7k5gPzsjzgEx7" target="_blank">Castleton village hall</a>.</p>

	<p>The day will be a range of talks from various speakers from as many local explorers and digging groups as we can get to talk. There will be something for everyone from the seasoned explorer to the new student keen to get involved. Come socialise, swap notes, chat about skills and techniques, tempt people over to come join you underground.</p>

	<p><i>*by Derbyshire we also mean, Peak District, Staffordshire, Nottinghamshire, South Yorkshire, Greater Manchester, Cheshire and anywhere else we've forgot.</i></p>
